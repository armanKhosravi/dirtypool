<!-- Selfish -->
<div class="w3-container" id="selfish" style="margin-top:75px" align="justify">
<h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Selfish mining.</b></h1>
<hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid #f04836" class="w3-round">
<p>
In year 2010, user RHorning described the idea of selfish mining in the Bitcoin forum <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2227.0"><b>bitcointalk</b></a>. The forum user provided simulation results for the attack, at the time called the mining cartel attack. Later in 2013 the term selfish mining and its formal description was introduced by Cornell researchers Emin Gün Sirer and Ittay Eyal in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243"><b>Majority is not enough: Bitcoin mining is vulnerable</b>.</a>
</p>
<p>
The selfish mining attack is a method for mining pools to increase their returns by not playing fair.
</p>
<p>
The selfish miner continues to mine the next block but not broadcast it. They continue to do so maintaining their lead. This way there would be a hidden fork in the blockchain which can only be seen by the selfish miner. When the rest of the network is about to catch up with the selfish miner then the selfish miner releases their portion of solved blocks into the blockchain.
</p>
<p>
The result is that their chain and proof of work is longer and more difficult so the rest of the network adopts their block solutions and they claim the block rewards.
</p>
</div>
<!-- Stubborn -->
<div class="w3-container" id="stubborn" style="margin-top:75px" align="justify">
<h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Stubborn mining.</b></h1>
<hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid #f04836" class="w3-round">
<p>
After introducing selfish mining some further researches showed that more generalized selfish mining strategies could be even more profitable.
</p>
<p>
for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7013"><b>Theoretical Bitcoin Attacks with less than Half of the Computational Power (draft)</b></a>
</p>
<p>
and specially <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/papers/5_stubborn_eclipse.pdf"><b>Stubborn Mining: Generalizing Selfish Mining and Combining with an Eclipse Attack</b></a>
</p>
<p>
provided a comprehensive generalization of selfish mining and also introduced different names for each of its variations:
</p>
<p><b>Lead Stubborn Mining Strategy</b></p>
<p>
A Lead Stubborn Miner waits until the honest miners catch up with him to broadcast all of his secret blocks as opposed to the selfish miner who does not take the risk of being caught by the honest miners and broadcasts his blocks if his advance shrinks to one block.
</p>
<p><b>j–Trail Stubborn Mining Strategy</b></p>
<p>
trail Stubborn Mining is an amelioration of Lead Stubborn Mining. When a trail Stubborn Miner's private chain falls behind the public chain, they may decide to continue mining on it anyway, in the hope of catching up. We consider a family of trail stubborn strategies parameterized by a threshold j, such that a j–trail stubborn miner accepts the public blockchain only when their private chain falls behind the public chain by j + 1 blocks). So by definition the 1–trail stubborn mining is the same as lead stubborn mining. Here we study only 2–trail, 3–trail and 4–trail stubborn mining since the other trail stubborn strategies can be easily dominated by other strategies.
</p>
<p><b>Equal Fork Stubborn Mining Strategy</b></p>
<p>
An Equal Fork Stubborn Miner waits for the official blockchain to overcome his secret fork by one block. He/she only gives up when the length of the official blockchain is equal to the length of his secret fork plus one.
</p>
</div>
<!-- Try -->
<div class="w3-container" id="try" style="margin-top:75px" align="justify">
<h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Try it yourself.</b></h1>
<hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid #f04836" class="w3-round">
<p>
Of course these strategies are not generally more profitable than the honest mining strategy. For example if you own even a 25% hash rate share of the network (which is usually denoted by &alpha;), being a selfish miner would never be more profitable than being an honest miner unless for some reason more than half of the other miners chose to mine on the fork you have created (which is usually denoted by &gamma;).
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in seeing when you can exploit the network by being a selfish or a stubborn miner in the next section you can find a simulation of these strategies. You can change the sliders and click the simulate button to see that in comparison with an honest miner, which strategy is more profitable and by how much.
</p>
<p>
This is a simulation based on a random number generator used in the simulation of mining a block, so every time you push the button the results would be a little bit different.
</p>
So
<ul class="b">
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&alpha;&nbsp; is your hash rate share of the network.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gamma;&nbsp; is the proportion of honest miners who mine on the fork you created.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp; is the number of attack cycles you're willing to perform.</li>

In this webpage you can easily calculate the profitability for any chosen &alpha; and &gamma; and see which strategy performs better in that specific situation. Now let's do the same for the whole range of &alpha; and &gamma;, this gives us a <b>2-dimentional graph</b> to compare the performance of different strategies. Below you can see the expected results from

	The simulation you find on this website is based on <b>finite-state machine</b>, just like previous works (such as <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~kartik/papers/5_stubborn_eclipse.pdf"><b>Stubborn Mining: Generalizing Selfish Mining and Combining with an Eclipse Attack</b></a>) which lacks the implementation of time, therefore cannot be used to calculate <b>time before profitability</b>. To analyze time we need anothger type of simulation. By simulating a peer-to-peer network we can acheive this, since this way we have a real network and different nodes to simulate different mining strategies.
	</p>
	<p>Study of <b>time before profitability</b> is not the only advantage of a peer-to-peer network simulation, study shows the resaults obtained by such simulations are much more reliable. Here you can see some <b>finitr-state machine</b> simulations and compare the resutls with a <b>peer-to-peer network simulation.</b></p>

	<p class="w3-xlarge w3-text-black" style="margin-top:75px"><b>Number of Difficulty Adjustment.</b></p>	
	
	
	
	<p>Time analysis of the attack cycles as previously mentioned in the introduction has been initially considered in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b>On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a>. They proved an unprecedented
property of a network including a block withholding strategy; no strategy is
more profitable than the honest strategy before a difficulty adjustment. This
means there would be no benefit of adopting a block withholding strategy in
short term, no matter how high is your hashrate share or propagation factor,
since the attacker has to wait for the difficulty adjustment to start its profit.
Apparently, the block withholding strategies exploit a flaw in the difficulty
adjustment formula since the parameter used to update the mining difficulty
is supposed to measure the actual hashing power of the network and In the
presence of a block withholding miner, this is no longer applicable.
</p>	
	
	
	<p>If we consider the number of difficulty adjustments as the third dimension then we get this visualization.</p>

	<video width="50%" autoplay muted loop id="myVideo1">

	<p>In the next visualization we see the optimal strategy before and after the difficulty
adjustment, based on analytical results of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b>On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a> on the left, which shows these strategies can only become profitable after the difficulty adjustment,
otherwise, the honest mining will remain the optimal strategy.
Now let’s compare that with the results obtained by our peer-to-peer simulation. Yoy see on the right we included the exact diagram of our simulated results which you see earlier but this time in different sections of increasing mined blocks, specifically each section is exactly one
block behind the next difficulty adjustment to demonstrate the full impact

	<!-- Pre-Profitability Period -->
<div class="w3-container" id="ppp" style="margin-top:75px" align="justify">
<h1 class="w3-xxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Pre&ndash;Profitability Period.</b></h1>
<hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid #f04836" class="w3-round">
<p>
After finding the winner strategy in the previous section, it's very important to realize which strategy leads to profit in a shorter time period. Time before profit or pre-profitibily period is the minimum time for a strategy such that the number of blocks mined by the selfish miner in the official blockchain would be greater than the average number of blocks mined by the miner if they chose to mine honestly from the beginning. You can read more about this in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b>On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a>.
</p>
<p>
Now let's compare the simulation results<sup>*</sup>  with the findings of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b>On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a> specially the part related to time before profit.
</p>
<p>
<sup>*</sup> The folowing results come from another more sophisticated simulation that the one you find on this webpage.
</p>
<p>
The minimum time in which the attacker becomes profitable has been studied in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b> On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a> for the first time. It means the duration of time in which the attacker
overcomes the honest miners. Such an analysis of time, was not possible
using only Markov models. The authors used their new approach to model
the duration of the attack cycles and consequently they could compute that
how long it would take for the selfish mining strategy to become profitable,
as the previously proved such a block withholding strategy is not profitable
at the beginning before any difficulty change.
</p>
<p>
Below you can see if we consider γ = 0.50 and compute the time after which the selfish mining
strategy becomes more profitable than the honest mining strategy for values of &alpha;, we'll see
in the first figure (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b> On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a>), the selfish miner needs at least 25% of the
computing hash power of the pool (α ≈ 0.25) to start to overcome the honest strategy
and by increasing the hashing power, the time it needs to surpass the honest
strategy decreases until it reaches its minimum which is around three weeks
and three days at the hashrate share of α ≈ 0.43. It is very interesting that
after this point Increasing the hasrate share leads to a longer waiting period before surpassing honest miners so higher computation power does not always mean
the profitability will be reached sooner. This could be the result of the greater
distance between the apparent hashrate of the mega-powerful selfish miner
and the honest miners because it needs a lot more work to surpass honest
miners by a huge margin rather than a small one. Another interesting point
in this study is, increasing the hashrate share of the selfish miner leads at
most to the duration of four weeks, consequently for a propagation factor of
fifty percent, there would be an optimum point for hashrate share of a selfish
miner between twenty-five and fifty percent hashrate share which leads to a
duration of fewer than four weeks.
</p>
On the other hand in the second figure which is based on the results of our simulation we can see the
same pattern. Specifically, the minimum pre-profitability period occurs at α ≈ 0.42 in around two weeks and two days. In general, the pre-profitability period in the simulation is a little bit less than expected
analytical results of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b> On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a>. This could be the result of the fact that
the performance of the selfish mining strategy in action in terms of apparent
hashrate (as you can see yourself in the simulation) the apparent hashrate of selfish mining strategy
is lower than the expected analytical results of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b> On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a> and since it is easier for
the attacker to achieve less apparent hashrate than more, the pre-profitability period
can be shorter.

<b>
We can see the same pattern in each strategy which consits of having a decrease in time before profitability by increasing the hashrate share until we reach the minimum time and start to see an increase until we get around 4 weeks as the time before profitability. 
</b>
	<p>
	We can also compare difficulty adjustments of different strategies. To do so we use difficulty-hashrate diagram since the difficulty adjustment of selfish mining does not depend on the propagation factor (&gamma;).

<p>
Although some mathematical formulations for these strategies have been developed before, they usually lack a consideration of the time(duration) of the attack and also the proper analysis of the costs of the attack. For example in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06183"><b>Optimal Selfish Mining Strategies in Bitcoin</b></a>
selfish mining strategies are considered to be optimal. The same goes for some textbooks like
<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10908.html"><b>Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies</b></a> and
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3002702"><b>Distributed Ledger Technology: The Science of the Blockchain</b></a> .
</p>
<p>
In contrast in year 2018 three articles
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08281"><b>On Profitability of Selfish Mining</b></a> , <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01041"><b>On Profitability of Stubborn Mining</b></a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09322"><b>On Profitability of Trailing Mining</b></a>
were published providing a deep and comprehensive study on these strategies.

<p>
Let's take a look at some parts of the these articles.
</p>
<p>
As you know
</p>
<ul class="b">
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>

&nbsp; is your hash rate share of the network.
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>&beta;</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; is the others' hash rate share of the network (

</math>
) .
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>&lambda;</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; is the relative hashing power of the attacker (

) .
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>&gamma;</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; is the proportion of honest miners who mine on the fork you created.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
you should also know
</p>
<ul class="b">
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>b</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; is the reward for finding a block.
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<msub>
<mi>&tau;</mi>
<mrow>
<mi>0</mi>
</mrow>
</msub>
</math>
&nbsp; is the average inter-block validation time (which is around 10 minutes for bitcoin).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
now we define
</p>
<ul class="b">
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>A</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; as your <b>Apparent Hash Rate</b> (find the definition below).
</li>
<li>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<math>
<mi>P</mi>
</math>
&nbsp; as your <b>Profitability Ratio</b> (find the definition below).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
First of all your <b>Hash Rate</b> ( 
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>
</math>
) means that we expect in the long term the average proportion of blocks mined by you would be also 
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>
</math>
. Then since you are adapting a selfish or stubborn strategy the average proportion of blocks mined by you could be different than 
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>
</math>
so we define your <b>Apparent Hash Rate</b> ( 
<math>
<mi>A</mi>
</math>
) which is a function of 
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>
</math>
and 
<math>
<mi>&gamma;</mi>
</math>
. On the other hand <b>Profitability Ratio</b> ( 
<math>
<mi>P</mi>
</math>
) is a function of 
<math>
<mi>&alpha;</mi>
</math>
, 
<math>
<mi>&gamma;</mi>
</math>
, 
<math>
<mi>b</mi>
</math>
and 
<math>
<msub>
<mi>&tau;</mi>
<mrow>
<mi>0</mi>
</mrow>
</msub>
</math>
which is the benchmark for the comparison of different strategies, more precisely, strategy 
<math>
<mi>x</mi>
</math>
is more profitable than strategy 
<math>
<mi>y</mi>
</math>
if and only if 
<math>
<msub>
<mi>P</mi>
<mrow>
<mi>y</mi>
</mrow>
</msub>
</math>

<mo>&lt;</mo>
</math>
<math>
<msub>
<mi>P</mi>
<mrow>
<mi>x</mi>
</mrow>
</msub>
</math>
.
</p>
<p>
For example profitability ratio of selfish mining strategy ( 
<math>
<msub>
<mi>P</mi>
<mrow>
<mi>sm</mi>
</mrow>
</msub>
</math>
) has different values before and after difficulty adjustment:

The reason for that as described in the article is: 
</p>
<blockquote style='font-style: italic'>
&ldquo;The protocol underestimates the real hashing power in the network since only the blocks that are in the (offcial) blockchain are taken into account. The number of orphan blocks grows in the presence of a selfish miner and a signicant
amount of honest hash rate is lost. The average time used by the network to validate
blocks increases. After 2016 blocks, a difficulty adjustment is done automatically
ignoring the production of orphan blocks. Despite the fact that the total hashing
power of the network remains the same, the new difficulty is lower than it should be,
and the block validation time decreases. So the revenue per unit of time of the selfish
miner improves and makes the attack profitable.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
<p>
Here you can find profitability ratio and apparent hash rate of different strategies:
